## Neuropsychological prediction

This prediction model is based on the data collected for the study [Complexity in neuropsychological assessments of cognitive impairment: A network analysis approach](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31846889/) (see full ref below).  
It uses sociodemographic and neuropsychological examination data to predict the diagnosis of the patient. It distinguishes betweeen healthy patients ("Healthy"), patients with possible Alzheimer's Disease ("AD") or patients with Vascular Encephalopathy ("VaE").  
This is both practice on how to apply machine learning techniques to neuropsychological data and a practice exercise on how to use and apply FastAPI and Docker.  

The accuracy of the chosen model (Support Vector Machine) is just above 75%. This model uses a very limited dataset and is only inteded as a practice/proof of concept exercise.
